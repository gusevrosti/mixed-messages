# A random knock-knock joke and positive wish

It is my first FS Engineering Portfolio Project via Codecademy.<br>
Also, it is my first (kind of) attempt at writing a README file using markdown.

## The functionality of the code is (very simple) following:
- It logs a random knock-knock joke and message with a positive wish once it's run.
  - The "random" parts of the output are stored in different string arrays.
  - These parts' indices are used to construct the output message.
  - Indices are chosen randomly via the Math.random() method.

## To run the code:
1. You need *node.js* installed on your machine.
2. In your terminal/CMD navigate to the directory (mixed-messages) with the *main.js* file and run the following command: 
  - node main.js
